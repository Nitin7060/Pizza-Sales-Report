# Pizza-Sales-Report

* I have designed this dashboard To Describe analytical insight.
* Worth of Sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

# key Factor Points
* How many customers do we have each day.
* How many pizzas are typically in an order
* Do we have any bestsellers
* How much money did we make this year.
* Can we identify any seasonality in the sales
* Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage.

# Important insights from the Dashboard

* The best-selling pizza is the Thai Chicken Pizza.
* The total profit made this year is $817.86K, and people are more interested in Thai chicken and spicy Italian pizzas.
* We should remove Brie Carre Pizza and Green Garden Pizza from the menu since they are the least popular pizzas.
